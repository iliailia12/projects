            <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) </b></p>
            <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It <br>
                defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) <br>
                and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br>
                
                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<br>
                 HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.<br>
                
                HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive<br>
                 forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural <br>
                 semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags<br>,
                  written using angle brackets. Tags such as  and  directly introduce content into <br>
                the page. Other tags such as  and  surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element <br>
                tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.<br>
                
                HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web <br>
                pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer<br>
                 of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML<br>
                  since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the  element,<br>
                     together with JavaScript.</p><br>
            <h1>History</h1>
            <p><b>Development</b></p>
            <p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use<br>
                 and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML<br>
                  and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a <br>
                  joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many<br>
                   areas in which hypertext is used"; <br>
                an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]</p><br>
                <img src="Tim_Berners-Lee_April_2009.jpg" alt="">
                <p>The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[5] first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in <br>
                    late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were ]<br>
                    strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of <br>
                    these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]<br>
                    <br>
                    HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visible or audible <br>
                    web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be <br>
                    altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical <br>
                    <br>
                    report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF<br>
                     command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS
                     (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to <br>
                     manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with<br>
                      attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been progressively moved in this<br>
                      direction with CSS.<br>
                      <br>
                    Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering <br>
                    Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the <br>
                    "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML <br>
                    Document type definition to define the syntax.[9][10] The draft expired after six months, but was notable <br>
                    for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the <br>
                    IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet Draft, "HTML+ <br>
                    (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.[11]<br>
                    <br>
                    After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group. In 1995, this working group completed "HTML<br>
                     2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.[12]<br>
                     <br>
                    Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been<br>
                     maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).[13] In 2000, HTML became an international<br>
                      standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004, development began <br>
                      on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and was<br>
                       completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.</p><br>

                            HTML 3.2[15] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C,<br>
                             as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.[16]<br>
                            Initially code-named "Wilbur",[17] HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions<br>
                             and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual<br>
                              agreement between the two companies.[13] A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that of HTML was <br>
                            standardized 14 months later in MathML.</p><br>

                                HTML 4.0[18] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three variations:<br>
                                Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden<br>
                                Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed
                                Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.<br>
                                Initially code-named "Cougar",[17] HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but also sought to phase out Netscape's <br>
                                visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO 8879 – SGML.[19]<br>

                                         action. It included many of the capabilities that were in Raggett's HTML+ proposal, such as support for tables, text flow around figures,<br>
                                          and the display of complex mathematical formulas.[44]<br>
                                        W3C began development of its own Arena browser as a test bed for HTML 3 and Cascading Style Sheets,[45][46][47] but HTML 3.0 did not succeed<br>
                                         for several reasons. The draft was considered very large at 150 pages and the pace of browser development, as well as the number of interested <br>
                                         parties, had outstripped the resources of the IETF.[13] Browser vendors, including Microsoft and Netscape at the time, chose to implement <br>
                                         different subsets of HTML 3's draft features as well as to introduce their own extensions to it.[13] (See browser wars.) These included<br>
                                          extensions to control stylistic aspects of documents, contrary to the "belief [of the academic engineering community] that such things <br>
                                          as text color, background texture, font size, and font face were definitely outside the scope of a language when their only intent was <br>
                                          to specify how a document would be organized."[13] Dave Raggett, who has been a W3C Fellow for many years, has commented for example: <br>
                                          "To a certain extent, Microsoft built its business on the Web by<br>

                                            Although its syntax closely resembles that of SGML, HTML5 has abandoned any attempt to be an SGML application and has<br>

                                            standard to "HTML". The W3C <br><br>
                                            nevertheless continues its project to release HTML5.[51]<br>
                                            2012 HTML5 – Candidate Recommendation<br>
                                            In July 2012, WHATWG and W3C decided on a degree of separation. W3C will continue the HTML5 specification work, focusing<br>
                                             on a single definitive<br>
                                             standard, which is considered a "snapshot" by WHATWG. The WHATWG organization will continue its work with HTML5 as a <br>
                                             "Living Standard". <br>
                                             The concept of a living standard is that it is never complete and is always being updated and improved. New features can be added but<br>
                                              functionality will not be removed.[52]<br>
                                            In December 2012, W3C designated HTML5 as a Candidate Recommendation.[53] The criterion for advancement to W3C Recommendation is <br>
                                            "two 100% complete and fully interoperable implementations".[54]<br>
                                            2014 HTML5 – Proposed Recommendation and Recommendation<br>
                                            In September 2014, W3C moved HTML5 to Proposed Recommendation.[55]<br>
                                            On 28 October 2014, HTML5 was released as a stable W3C Recommendation,[56] meaning the specification process is complete.[57]<br><br>
                                            XHTML versions<br><br>

                                            XHTML is a separate language that began as a reformulation of HTML 4.01 using XML 1.0. It is now referred to as the XML syntax for HTML<br>
                                             and is no longer being developed as a separate standard.[58]<br>
                                            
                                            XHTML 1.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation on January 26, 2000,[59] and was later revised and republished on August 1, 2002. It <br>
                                            offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and 4.01, reformulated in XML, with minor restrictions.<br>
                                            XHTML 1.1[60] was published as a W3C Recommendation on May 31, 2001. It is based on XHTML 1.0 Strict, but includes minor changes,<br>
                                             can be customized, and is reformulated using modules in the W3C recommendation "Modularization of XHTML", which was published on <br><br><br>
                                             April 10, 2001.[61]<br>
                                            XHTML 2.0 was a working draft. Work on it was abandoned in 2009 in favor of work on HTML5 and XHTML5.[62][63][64] XHTML 2.0 was <br>
                                            incompatible with XHTML 1.x and, therefore, would be more accurately characterized as an XHTML-inspired new language than an update <br>
                                            to XHTML 1.x.<br>

                                            On 28 May 2019, the W3C announced that WHATWG would be the sole publisher of the HTML and DOM standards.[65][66][67][68] <br>
                                            The W3C and WHATWG had been publishing competing standards since 2012. While the W3C standard was identical to the WHATWG <br>
                                            in 2007 the standards have since progressively diverged due to different design decisions.[69] The WHATWG "Living Standard"<br>
                                             had been the de facto web standard for some time.[70]</p><br>
                                             <h1>Markup</h1>
                                             <p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-
                                                based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like <h1> and </h1>, 
                                                although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <img>. The first tag in such a pair is the start <br>
                                                tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).<br>

                                                Another important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.<br>
                                                
                                                The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:<br>

                                                  </body><br>
                                                </html><br>
                                                The text between <html> and </html> describes the web page, and the text between <body> and </body> is the visible page <br>
                                                content. The markup text <title>This is a title</title> defines the browser page title shown on browser tabs and window<br>
                                                titles and the tag <div> defines a division of the page used for easy styling. Between <head> and </head>, a <meta> element<br>
                                                     can be used to define webpage metadata.<br>
                                                
                                                The Document Type Declaration <!DOCTYPE html> is for HTML5. If a declaration is not included, various browsers will<br>
                                                 revert to "quirks mode" for rendering.[71]<br>

                                                HTML element content categories<br>
                                                HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements. These are indicated in the document by HTML tags, enclosed in <br>
                                                angle brackets thus: <p>.[72][better source needed]<br>
                                                
                                                In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a "start tag" <p> and "end tag" <br>
                                                    <br>
                                                </p>. The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.<br>
                                                
                                                Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and text. This <br>
                                                indicates further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element.<br>
                                                
                                                The start tag may also include the element's attributes within the tag. These indicate other information, such as <br>
                                                identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style information to the presentation of the<br>
                                                 document, and for some tags such as the <img> used to embed images, the reference to the image resource in the<br>
                                                  format like this: <img src="example.com/example.jpg"><br>
                                                
                                                Some elements, such as the line break <br /> do not permit any embedded content, either text or further tags.<br> 
                                                These require only a single empty tag (akin to a start tag) and do not use an end tag.<br>
                                                
                                                Many tags, particularly the closing end tag for the very commonly used paragraph element <p>, are optional. An<br>
                                                     HTML browser or other agent can infer the closure for the end of an element from the context and the <br>
                                                     structural rules defined by the HTML standard. These rules are complex and not widely understood by <br>
                                                     most HTML authors.
                                                
                                                The general form of an HTML element is therefore: <tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2">''content''<br>

                                                </tag>. Some HTML elements are defined as empty elements and take the form <tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2">.<br>
                                                     Empty elements may enclose no content, for instance, the <br /> tag or the inline <img> tag. The name of an HTML element is the<br>
                                                      name used in the tags. The end tag's name is preceded by a slash character, /, and that in empty elements the end tag is neither<br>
                                                       required nor allowed. If attributes are not mentioned, default values are used in each case.<br>

                                                <br><br>
                                                There are several types of markup elements used in HTML:<br><br>
                                                
                                                Structural markup indicates the purpose of text<br>
                                                For example, <h2>Golf</h2> establishes "Golf" as a second-level heading. Structural markup does not denote any specific<br>
                                                 rendering, but most web browsers have default styles for element formatting. Content may be further styled using Cascading <br>
                                                 Style Sheets (CSS).[73]<br>
                                                Presentational markup indicates the appearance of the text, regardless of its purpose<br>
                                                For example, <b>bold text</b> indicates that visual output devices should render "boldface" in bold text, but gives a little <br>
                                                indication what devices that are unable to do this (such as aural devices that read the text aloud) should do. In the case of<br>
                                                 both <b>bold text</b> and <i>italic text</i>, there are other elements that may have equivalent visual renderings but that<br>
                                                  are more semantic in nature, such as <strong>strong text</strong> and <em>emphasized text</em> respectively. It is easier t<br>
                                                  o see how an aural user agent should interpret the latter two elements. However, they are not equivalent to their presentational <br>
                                                  counterparts: it would be undesirable for a screen reader to emphasize the name of a book, for instance, but on a screen, such a<br>
                                                   name would be italicized. Most presentational markup elements have become deprecated under the HTML 4.0 specification in favor <br>
                                                   of using CSS for styling.<br>
                                                Hypertext markup makes parts of a document into links to other documents<br>
                                                An anchor element creates a hyperlink in the document and its href attribute sets the link's target URL. For example, the HTML<br>
                                                 markup <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, will render the word "Wikipedia" as a hyperlink. To render an image <br>
                                                 as a hyperlink, an img element is inserted as content into the a element. Like br, img is an empty element with attributes but <br>
                                                 no content or closing tag. <a href="https://example.org"><img src="image.gif" alt="descriptive text" width="50" height="50" border="0"></a>.<br>
                                                Attributes<br>
                                                Main article: HTML attribute
                                                Most of the attributes of an element are name–value pairs, separated by = and written within the start tag of an element after the<br>
                                                 element's name. The value may be enclosed in single or double quotes, although values consisting of certain characters can be <br>
                                                 eft unquoted in HTML (but not XHTML).[74][75] Leaving attribute values unquoted is considered unsafe.[76] In contrast with name-<br>
                                                 value pair attributes, there are some attributes that affect the element simply by their presence in the start tag of the element,[<br>
                                                 6] like the ismap attribute for the img element.[77]<br>
                                                
                                                There are several common attributes that may appear in many elements :<br>
                                                
                                                The id attribute provides a document-wide unique identifier for an element. This is used to identify the element so that stylesheets can <br>
                                                alter its presentational properties, and scripts may alter, animate or delete its contents or presentation. Appended to the URL of the page, <br>
                                                it provides a globally unique identifier for the element, typically a sub-section of the page. For example, the ID "Attributes" in<br>
                                                 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#Attributes.<br>
                                                The class attribute provides a way of classifying similar elements. This can be used for semantic or presentation purposes. For example,<br>
                                                 an HTML document might semantically use the designation <class="notation"> to indicate that all elements with this class value are <br>
                                                    subordinate to the main text of the document. In presentation, such elements might be gathered together and presented as footnotes <br>
                                                    on a page instead of appearing in the place where they occur in the HTML source. Class attributes are used semantically in microformats.<br>
                                                     Multiple class values may be specified; for example <class="notation important"> puts the element into both the notation and the<br>
                                                         important classes.<br>
                                                An author may use the style attribute to assign presentational properties to a particular element. It is considered better practice to use<br>
                                                 an element's id or class attributes to select the element from within a stylesheet, though sometimes this can be too cumbersome for a simple,<br>
                                                  specific, or ad hoc styling.<br>
                                                The title attribute is used to attach a subtextual explanation to an element. In most browsers this attribute is displayed as a tooltip.<br>
                                                The lang attribute identifies the natural language of the element's contents, which may be different from that of the rest of the document.<br>
                                                 For example, in an English-language document:<br>
                                                <p>Oh well, <span lang="fr">c'est la vie</span>, as they say in France.</p><br>
                                                The abbreviation element, abbr, can be used to demonstrate some of these attributes:<br>
                                                
                                                <abbr id="anId" class="jargon" style="color:purple;" title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr><br>
                                                This example displays as HTML; in most browsers, pointing the cursor at the abbreviation should display the title text "Hypertext<br>
                                                 Markup Language."<br>
                                                
                                                Most elements take the language-related attribute dir to specify text direction, such as with "rtl" for right-to-left text in, for<br>
                                                 example, Arabic, Persian or Hebrew.[78]<br>
                                                
                                                Character and entity references<br>
                                                See also: List of XML and HTML character entity references and Unicode and HTML<br>
                                                As of version 4.0, HTML defines a set of 252 character entity references and a set of 1,114,050 numeric character references,<br>
                                                 both of which allow individual characters to be written via simple markup, rather than literally. A literal character and its <br>
                                                 markup counterpart are considered equivalent and are rendered identically.<br>
                                                
                                                The ability to "escape" characters in this way allows for the characters < and & (when written as &lt; and &amp;, respectively) to<br>
                                                 be interpreted as character data, rather than markup. For example, a literal < normally indicates the start of a tag, and & normally <br>
                                                 indicates the start of a character entity reference or numeric character reference; writing it as &amp; or &#x26; or &#38; allows & <br>
                                                 to be included in the content of an element or in the value of an attribute. The double-quote character ("), when not used to quote <br>
                                                 an attribute value, must also be escaped as &quot; or &#x22; or &#34; when it appears within the attribute value itself. Equivalently,<br>
                                                  the single-quote character ('), when not used to quote an attribute value, must also be escaped as &#x27; or &#39; (or as &apos; in<br>
                                                   HTML5 or XHTML documents[79][80]) when it appears within the attribute value itself. If document authors overlook the need to escape<br>
                                                    such characters, some browsers can be very forgiving and try to use context to guess their intent. The result is still invalid markup,<br>
                                                     which makes the document less accessible to other browsers and to other user agents that may try to parse the document for search and <br>
                                                     indexing purposes for example.
                                                

                                                Escaping also allows for characters that are not easily typed, or that are not available in the document's character encoding,<br>
                                                 to be represented within the element and attribute content. For example, the acute-accented e (é), a character typically found<br>
                                                  only on Western European and South American keyboards, can be written in any HTML document as the entity reference &eacute; or as the numeric<br>
                                                   references &#xE9; or &#233;, using characters that are available on all keyboards and are supported in all character encodings. Unicode <br>
                                                   character encodings such as UTF-8 are compatible with all modern browsers and allow direct access to almost all the characters of the<br>
                                                   <br> world's writing systems.[81]<br>
                                                
                                                
                                                Data types
                                                HTML defines several data types for element content, such as script data and stylesheet data, and a plethora of types for attribute values, including IDs, names, URIs, numbers, units of length, languages, media descriptors, colors, character encodings, dates and times, and so on. All of these data types are specializations of character data.
                                                
                                                Document type declaration
                                                HTML documents are required to start with a Document type declaration (informally, a "doctype"). In browsers, the doctype helps to define the rendering mode—particularly whether to use quirks mode.
                                                
                                                The original purpose of the doctype was to enable the parsing and validation of HTML documents by SGML tools based on the Document type definition (DTD). The DTD to which the DOCTYPE refers contains a machine-readable grammar specifying the permitted and prohibited content for a document conforming to such a DTD. Browsers, on the other hand, do not implement HTML as an application of SGML and as consequence do not read the DTD.
                                                
                                                HTML5 does not define a DTD; therefore, in HTML5 the doctype declaration is simpler and shorter:[82]
                                                
                                                <!DOCTYPE html>
                                                An example of an HTML 4 doctype
                                                
                                                <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
                                                This declaration references the DTD for the "strict" version of HTML 4.01. SGML-based validators read the DTD in order to properly parse the document and to perform validation. In modern browsers, a valid doctype activates standards mode as opposed to quirks mode.
                                                
                                                In addition, HTML 4.01 provides Transitional and Frameset DTDs, as explained below. The transitional type is the most inclusive, incorporating current tags as well as older or "deprecated" tags, with the Strict DTD excluding deprecated tags. The frameset has all tags necessary to make frames on a page along with the tags included in transitional type.[83]
                                                
                                                Semantic HTML<br>
                                                Main article: Semantic HTML<br>
                                                Semantic HTML is a way of writing HTML that emphasizes the meaning of the encoded information over its presentation (look). HTML has included semantic markup from its inception,[84] but has also included presentational markup, such as <font>, <i> and <center> tags. There are also the semantically neutral div and span tags. Since the late 1990s, when Cascading Style Sheets were beginning to work in most browsers, web authors have been encouraged to avoid the use of presentational HTML markup with a view to the separation of content and presentation.[85]
                                                
                                                In a 2001 discussion of the Semantic Web, Tim Berners-Lee and others gave examples of ways in which intelligent software "agents" may one day automatically crawl the web and find, filter, and correlate previously unrelated, published facts for the benefit of human users.[86] Such agents are not commonplace even now, but some of the ideas of Web 2.0, mashups and price comparison websites may be coming close. The main difference between these web application hybrids and Berners-Lee's semantic agents lies in the fact that the current aggregation and hybridization of information is usually designed by web developers, who already know the web locations and the API semantics of the specific data they wish to mash, compare and combine.
                                                
                                                An important type of web agent that does crawl and read web pages automatically, without prior knowledge of what it might find, is the web crawler or search-engine spider. These software agents are dependent on the semantic clarity of web pages they find as they use various techniques and algorithms to read and index millions of web pages a day and provide web users with search facilities without which the World Wide Web's usefulness would be greatly reduced.
                                                
                                                In order for search engine spiders to be able to rate the significance of pieces of text they find in HTML documents, and also for those creating mashups and other hybrids as well as for more automated agents as they are developed, the semantic structures that exist in HTML need to be widely and uniformly applied to bring out the meaning of the published text.[87]
                                                
                                                Presentational markup tags are deprecated in current HTML and XHTML recommendations. The majority of presentational features from previous versions of HTML are no longer allowed as they lead to poorer accessibility, higher cost of site maintenance, and larger document sizes.[88]
                                                
                                                Good semantic HTML also improves the accessibility of web documents (see also Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). For example, when a screen reader or audio browser can correctly ascertain the structure of a document, it will not waste the visually impaired user's time by reading out repeated or irrelevant information when it has been marked up correctly.
                                                
                                                Delivery<br>
                                                HTML documents can be delivered by the same means as any other computer file. However, they are most often delivered either by HTTP from a web server or by email.
                                                <br>
                                                HTTP<br>
                                                Main article: Hypertext Transfer Protocol<br>
                                                The World Wide Web is composed primarily of HTML documents transmitted from web servers to web browsers using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). However, HTTP is used to serve images, sound, and other content, in addition to HTML. To allow the web browser to know how to handle each document it receives, other information is transmitted along with the document. This meta data usually includes the MIME type (e.g., text/html or application/xhtml+xml) and the character encoding (see Character encodings in HTML).
                                                
                                                In modern browsers, the MIME type that is sent with the HTML document may affect how the document is initially interpreted. A document sent with the XHTML MIME type is expected to be well-formed XML; syntax errors may cause the browser to fail to render it. The same document sent with the HTML MIME type might be displayed successfully since some browsers are more lenient with HTML.
                                                
                                                The W3C recommendations state that XHTML 1.0 documents that follow guidelines set forth in the recommendation's Appendix C may be labeled with either MIME Type.[89] XHTML 1.1 also states that XHTML 1.1 documents should[90] be labeled with either MIME type.[91]

                                                Most graphical email clients allow the use of a subset of HTML (often ill-defined) to provide formatting and semantic markup not available with plain text. This may include typographic information like colored headings, emphasized and quoted text, inline images and diagrams. Many such clients include both a GUI editor for composing HTML e-mail messages and a rendering engine for displaying them. Use of HTML in e-mail is criticized by some because of compatibility issues, because it can help disguise phishing attacks, because of accessibility issues for blind or visually impaired people, because it can confuse spam filters and because the message size is larger than plain text.

                                                The most common file<br>name extension for files containing HTML is .html. A common abbreviation of this is .htm, which originated because some early operating systems and file systems, such as DOS and the limitations imposed by FAT data structure, limited file extensions to three letters.[92]
                                                
                                                HTML Application<br>
                                                Main article: HTML Application<br>
                                                An HTML Application (HTA; file extension .hta) is a Microsoft Windows application that uses HTML and Dynamic HTML in a browser to provide the application's graphical interface. A regular HTML file is confined to the security model of the web browser's security, communicating only to web servers and manipulating only web page objects and site cookies. An HTA runs as a fully trusted application and therefore has more privileges, like creation/editing/removal of files and Windows Registry entries. Because they operate outside the browser's security model, HTAs cannot be executed via HTTP, but must be downloaded (just like an EXE file) and executed from local file system.
                                                
                                                HTML4 variations<br>
                                                Since its inception, HTML and its associated protocols gained acceptance relatively quickly. However, no clear standards existed in the early years of the language. Though its creators originally conceived of HTML as a semantic language devoid of presentation details,[93] practical uses pushed many presentational elements and attributes into the language, driven largely by the various browser vendors. The latest standards surrounding HTML reflect efforts to overcome the sometimes chaotic development of the language[94] and to create a rational foundation for building both meaningful and well-presented documents. To return HTML to its role as a semantic language, the W3C has developed style languages such as CSS and XSL to shoulder the burden of presentation. In conjunction, the HTML specification has slowly reined in the presentational elements.
                                                
                                                There are two axes differentiating various variations of HTML as currently specified: SGML-based HTML versus XML-based HTML (referred to as XHTML) on one axis, and strict versus transitional (loose) versus frameset on the other axis.
                                                
                                                SGML-based versus XML-based HTML<br>
                                                One difference in the latest[when?] HTML specifications lies in the distinction between the SGML-based specification and the XML-based specification. The XML-based specification is usually called XHTML to distinguish it clearly from the more traditional definition. However, the root element name continues to be "html" even in the XHTML-specified HTML. The W3C intended XHTML 1.0 to be identical to HTML 4.01 except where limitations of XML over the more complex SGML require workarounds. Because XHTML and HTML are closely related, they are sometimes documented in parallel. In such circumstances, some authors conflate the two names as (X)HTML or X(HTML).
                                                
                                                Like HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0 has three sub-specifications: strict, transitional, and frameset.<br>
                                                
                                                Aside from the different opening declarations for a document, the differences between an HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 document—in each of the corresponding DTDs—are largely syntactic. The underlying syntax of HTML allows many shortcuts that XHTML does not, such as elements with optional opening or closing tags, and even empty elements which must not have an end tag. By contrast, XHTML requires all elements to have an opening tag and a closing tag. XHTML, however, also introduces a new shortcut: an XHTML tag may be opened and closed within the same tag, by including a slash before the end of the tag like this: <br />. The introduction of this shorthand, which is not used in the SGML declaration for HTML 4.01, may confuse earlier software unfamiliar with this new convention. A fix for this is to include a space before closing the tag, as such: <br />.[95]
                                                
                                                To understand the subtle differences between HTML and XHTML, consider the transformation of a valid and well-formed XHTML 1.0 document that adheres to Appendix C (see below) into a valid HTML 4.01 document. Making this translation requires the following steps:
                                                
                                                The language for an element should be specified with a lang attribute rather than the XHTML xml:lang attribute. XHTML uses XML's built-in language-defining functionality attribute.
                                                Remove the XML namespace (xmlns=URI). HTML has no facilities for namespaces.<br>
                                                Change the document type declaration from XHTML 1.0 to HTML 4.01. (see DTD section fo<br>r further explanation).<br>
                                                If present, remove the XML declaration. (Typically this is: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>).<br>
                                                Ensure that the document's MIME type is set to text/html. For both HTML and XHTML, this comes from the HTTP Content-Type header sent by the server.
                                                Change the XML empty-element syntax to an HTML style empty element (<br /> to <br />).
                                                Those are the main changes necessary to translate a document from XHTML 1.0 to HTML 4.01. To translate from HTML to XHTML would also require the addition of any omitted opening or closing tags. Whether coding in HTML or XHTML it may just be best to always include the optional tags within an HTML document rather than remembering which tags can be omitted.
                                                
                                                A well-formed XHTML document adheres to all the syntax requirements of XML. A valid document adheres to the content specification for XHTML, which describes the document structure.
                                                
                                                The W3C recommends several conventions to ensure an easy migration between HTML and XHTML (see HTML Compatibility Guidelines). The following steps can be applied to XHTML 1.0 documents only:
                                                
                                                Include both xml:lang and lang attributes on any elements assigning language.<br>
                                                Use the empty-element syntax only for elements specified as empty in HTML.<br>
                                                Include an extra space in empty-element tags: for example <br /> instead of <br />.<br>
                                                Include explicit close tags for elements that permit content but are left empty (for example, , not <div />).<br>
                                                Omit the XML declaration.<br>
                                                By carefully following the W3C's compatibility guidelines, a user agent should be able to interpret the document equally as HTML or XHTML. For documents that are XHTML 1.0 and have been made compatible in this way, the W3C permits them to be served either as HTML (with a text/html MIME type), or as XHTML (with an application/xhtml+xml or application/xml MIME type). When delivered as XHTML, browsers should use an XML parser, which adheres strictly to the XML specifications for parsing the document's contents.
                                                
                                                Transitional versus strict<br>
                                                HTML 4 defined three different versions of the language: Strict, Transitional (once called Loose), and Frameset. The Strict version is intended for new documents and is considered best practice, while the Transitional and Frameset versions were developed to make it easier to transition documents that conformed to older HTML specifications or did not conform to any specification to a version of HTML 4. The Transitional and Frameset versions allow for presentational markup, which is omitted in the Strict version. Instead, cascading style sheets are encouraged to improve the presentation of HTML documents. Because XHTML 1 only defines an XML syntax for the language defined by HTML 4, the same differences apply to XHTML 1 as well.
                                                
                                                The Transitional version allows the following parts of the vocabulary, which are not included in the Strict version:<br>
                                                
                                                A looser content model<br>
                                                Inline elements and plain text are allowed directly in: body, blockquote, form, noscript and noframes<br>

                                                Frameset versus transitional<br>
                                                In addition to the above transitional differences, the frameset specifications (whether XHTML 1.0 or HTML 4.01) specify a different content model, with frameset replacing body, that contains either frame elements, or optionally noframes with a body.
                                                
                                                Summary of specification versions<br>
                                                As this list demonstrates, the loose versions of the specification are maintained for legacy support. However, contrary to popular misconceptions, the move to XHTML does not imply a removal of this legacy support. Rather the X in XML stands for extensible and the W3C is modularizing the entire specification and opens it up to independent extensions. The primary achievement in the move from XHTML 1.0 to XHTML 1.1 is the modularization of the entire specification. The strict version of HTML is deployed in XHTML 1.1 through a set of modular extensions to the base XHTML 1.1 specification. Likewise, someone looking for the loose (transitional) or frameset specifications will find similar extended XHTML 1.1 support (much of it is contained in the legacy or frame modules). Modularization also allows for separate features to develop on their own timetable. So for example, XHTML 1.1 will allow quicker migration to emerging XML standards such as MathML (a presentational and semantic math language based on XML) and XForms—a new highly advanced web-form technology to replace the existing HTML forms.
                                                
                                                In summary, the HTML 4 specification primarily reined in all the various HTML implementations into a single clearly written specification based on SGML. XHTML 1.0, ported this specification, as is, to the new XML-defined specification. Next, XHTML 1.1 takes advantage of the extensible nature of XML and modularizes the whole specification. XHTML 2.0 was intended to be the first step in adding new features to the specification in a standards-body-based approach.</p>

            <p><b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b></p>
            <img src="CSS3_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png" alt="">
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written 
                in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology 
                of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

                CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can 
                improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and c
                ontrol in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant 
                CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached 
                to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
                
                Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different 
                rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based 
                tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
                
                The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which declaration applies if more than one
                 declaration of a property match a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
                
                The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type)
                 text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service
                  for CSS documents.[5]
                
                In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL. CSS is 
                also used in the GTK widget toolkit.</p>
                <h1>Syntax</h1>
                <p>CSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of English keywords to specify the names of various style properties.

                    Style sheet
                    Main article: Style sheet (web development)
                    A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block.
                    
                    Selector
                    "CSS class" redirects here. For non-CSS use of element classes in HTML, see class attribute (HTML).
                    In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.
                    
                    Selector types
                    Selectors may apply to the following:
                    
                    all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2
                    elements specified by attribute, in particular:
                    id: an identifier unique within the document, denoted in the selector language by a hash prefix e.g. #id
                    class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document, denoted by a dot prefix e.g. .classname (the 
                    phrase "CSS class", although sometimes used, is a misnomer, as element classes—specified with the HTML class attribute—is
                     a markup feature that is distinct from browsers' CSS subsystem and the related W3C/WHATWG standards work on document styles; 
                     see RDF and microformats for the origins of the "class" system of the Web content model)
                    elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.
                    Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores.
                     A class may apply to any number of instances of any element. An ID may only be applied to a single element.
                    
                    Pseudo-classes
                    Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained in the document tree.
                    
                    One example of a widely used pseudo-class is :hover, which identifies content only when the user "points to" the visible 
                    element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended to a selector as in a:hover or #elementid:hover.
                    
                    A pseudo-class classifies document elements, such as :link or :visited, whereas a pseudo-element makes a selection that
                     may consist of partial elements, such as ::first-line or ::first-letter.[6] Note the distinction between the double-colon
                      notation used for pseudo-elements and the single-colon notation used for pseudo-classes.
                    
                    Combinators
                    Multiple simple selectors may be joined using combinators to specify elements by location, element type, id, class, or
                     any combination thereof.[7] The order of the selectors is important. For example, div .myClass {color: red;} applies 
                     to all elements of class myClass that are inside div elements, whereas .myClass div {color: red;} applies to all div 
                     elements that are inside elements of class myClass. This is not to be confused with concatenated identifiers such as 
                     div.myClass {color: red;} which applies to div elements of class myClass.
                    
                    Summary of selector syntax
                    The following table provides a summary of selector syntax indicating usage and the version of CSS that introduced it.</p>

                    <p>Declaration block
                        A declaration block consists of a pair of braces ({}) enclosing a semicolon-separated list of declarations.[9]
                        
                        Declaration
                        Each declaration itself consists of a property, a colon (:), and a value. Optional white-space may be around the declaration block, 
                        declarations, colons, and semi-colons for readability.[10]
                        
                        Properties
                        Properties are specified in the CSS standard. Each property has a set of possible values. Some properties can affect any type of
                        element, and others apply only to particular groups of elements.[11][12]
                        
                        Values
                        Values may be keywords, such as "center" or "inherit", or numerical values, such as 200px (200 pixels), 50vw (50 percent of
                         the viewport width) or 80% (80 percent of the parent element's width).
                        
                        Color values can be specified with keywords (e.g. "red"), hexadecimal values (e.g. #FF0000, also abbreviated as #F00), RGB values
                         on a 0 to 255 scale (e.g. rgb(255, 0, 0)), RGBA values that specify both color and alpha transparency (e.g. rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8)),
                          or HSL or HSLA values (e.g. hsl(0 100% 50%), hsl(0 100% 50% / 0.8)).[13]
                        
                        Non-zero numeric values representing linear measures must include a length unit, which is either an alphabetic code or abbreviation
                        , as in 200px or 50vw; or a percentage sign, as in 80%. Some units – cm (centimetre); in (inch); mm (millimetre); pc (pica); and pt 
                        (point) – are absolute, which means that the rendered dimension does not depend upon the structure of the page; others – em (em); ex
                         (ex) and px (pixel)[clarification needed] – are relative, which means that factors such as the font size of a parent element can a
                         fect the rendered measurement. These eight units were a feature of CSS 1[14] and retained in all subsequent revisions. The proposed
                          CSS Values and Units Module Level 3 will, if adopted as a W3C Recommendation, provide seven further length units:
                         ch; Q; rem; vh; vmax; vmin; and vw.[15]</p>
                         <h1><strong><b>Use</b></strong></h1>
                         <p>Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML markup. All font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders, and sizes had to be explicitly described, often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much of that information to another file, the style sheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML. And additionally, as more and more devices are able to access responsive web pages, different screen sizes and layouts begin to appear. Customizing a website for each device size is costly and increasingly difficult. The modular nature of CSS means that styles can be reused in different parts of a site or even across sites, promoting consistency and efficiency.

                            For example, headings (h1 elements), sub-headings (h2), sub-sub-headings (h3), etc., are defined structurally using HTML. In print and on the screen, choice of font, size, color and emphasis for these elements is presentational.
                            
                            Before CSS, document authors who wanted to assign such typographic characteristics to, say, all h2 headings had to repeat HTML presentational markup for each occurrence of that heading type. This made documents more complex, larger, and more error-prone and difficult to maintain. CSS allows the separation of presentation from structure. CSS can define color, font, text alignment, size, borders, spacing, layout and many other typographic characteristics, and can do so independently for on-screen and printed views. CSS also defines non-visual styles, such as reading speed and emphasis for aural text readers. The W3C has now deprecated the use of all presentational HTML markup.[16]
                            
                            For example, under pre-CSS HTML, a heading element defined with red text would be written as:
                            
                            <h1><font color="red">Chapter 1.</font></h1>
                            Using CSS, the same element can be coded using style properties instead of HTML presentational attributes:
                            
                            <h1 style="color: red;">Chapter 1.</h1>
                            The advantages of this may not be immediately clear but the power of CSS becomes more apparent when the style properties are placed in an internal style element or, even better, an external CSS file. For example, suppose the document contains the style element:
                            
                            <style>
                                h1 {
                                    color: red;
                                }
                            </style>
                            All h1 elements in the document will then automatically become red without requiring any explicit code. If the author later wanted to make h1 elements blue instead, this could be done by changing the style element to:
                            
                            <style>
                                h1 {
                                    color: blue;
                                }
                            </style>
                            rather than by laboriously going through the document and changing the color for each individual h1 element.
                            
                            The styles can also be placed in an external CSS file, as described below, and loaded using syntax similar to:
                            
                            <link href="path/to/file.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
                            This further decouples the styling from the HTML document and makes it possible to restyle multiple documents by simply
                             editing a shared external CSS file.
                            
                            Sources
                            CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, offers a flexible way to style web content, with styles originating from browser defaults, user 
                            preferences, or web designers. These styles can be applied inline, within an HTML document, or through external .css files for 
                            broader consistency. Not only does this simplify web development by promoting reusability and maintainability, it also improves
                             site performance because styles can be offloaded into dedicated .css files that browsers can cache. Additionally, even if the 
                             styles cannot be loaded or are disabled, this separation maintains the accessibility and readability of the content, ensuring t
                             hat the site is usable for all users, including those with disabilities. Its multi-faceted approach, including considerations 
                             for selector specificity, rule order, and media types, ensures that websites are visually coherent and adaptive across different 
                             devices and user needs, striking a balance between design intent and user accessibility.
                            
                            Multiple style sheets
                            Multiple style sheets can be imported. Different styles can be applied depending on the output device being used; for example,
                             the screen version can be quite different from the printed version, so authors can tailor the presentation appropriately for 
                             each medium.
                            
                            Cascading
                            The style sheet with the highest priority controls the content display. Declarations not set in the highest priority source 
                            are passed on to a source of lower priority, such as the user agent style. The process is called cascading.
                            
                            One of the goals of CSS is to allow users greater control over presentation. Someone who finds red italic headings difficult
                             to read may apply a different style sheet. Depending on the browser and the website, a user may choose from various style 
                             sheets provided by the designers, or may remove all added styles, and view the site using the browser's default styling, or
                              may override just the red italic heading style without altering other attributes. Browser extensions like Stylish and Styl
                              us have been created to facilitate the management of such user style sheets. In the case of large projects, cascading can b
                              e used to determine which style has a higher priority when developers do integrate third-party styles that have conflicting 
                              priorities, and to further resolve those conflicts. Additionally, cascading can help create themed designs, which help design
                              ers fine-tune aspects of a design without compromising the overall layout.

                        <p>Specificity refers to the relative weights of various rules.[17] It determines which styles
                             apply to an element when more than one rule could apply. Based on the specification, a simple s
                             elector (e.g. H1) has a specificity of 1, class selectors have a specificity of 1,0, and ID sel
                             ectors have a specificity of 1,0,0. Because the specificity values do not carry over as in the decim
                             al system, commas are used to separate the "digits"[18] (a CSS rule having 11 elements and 11 classes would
                              have a specificity of 11,11, not 121).

                            Thus the selectors of the following rule result in the indicated specificity:</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <h1>History</h1>
                            <p>CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on 10 October 1994.[23] At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.[24] Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1)[25] being released in 1996. In particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was influential; he became co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.[26]

                                Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web.[27] One requirement for a web style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on the web. Therefore, existing style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, let a document's style be influenced by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading" styles.[27]
                                
                                As HTML grew, it came to encompass a wider variety of stylistic capabilities to meet the demands of web developers. This evolution gave the designer more control over site appearance, at the cost of more complex HTML. Variations in web browser implementations, such as ViolaWWW and WorldWideWeb,[28] made consistent site appearance difficult, and users had less control over how web content was displayed. The browser/editor developed by Tim Berners-Lee had style sheets that were hard-coded into the program. The style sheets could therefore not be linked to documents on the web.[24] Robert Cailliau, also of CERN, wanted to separate the structure from the presentation so that different style sheets could describe different presentation for printing, screen-based presentations, and editors.[28]
                                
                                Improving web presentation capabilities was a topic of interest to many in the web community and nine different style sheet languages were proposed on the www-style mailing list.[27] Of these nine proposals, two were especially influential on what became CSS: Cascading HTML Style Sheets[23] and Stream-based Style Sheet Proposal (SSP).[26][29] Two browsers served as testbeds for the initial proposals; Lie worked with Yves Lafon to implement CSS in Dave Raggett's Arena browser.[30][31][32] Bert Bos implemented his own SSP proposal in the Argo browser.[26] Thereafter, Lie and Bos worked together to develop the CSS standard (the 'H' was removed from the name because these style sheets could also be applied to other markup languages besides HTML).[24]
                                
                                Lie's proposal was presented at the "Mosaic and the Web" conference (later called WWW2) in Chicago, Illinois in 1994, and again with Bert Bos in 1995.[24] Around this time the W3C was already being established and took an interest in the development of CSS. It organized a workshop toward that end chaired by Steven Pemberton. This resulted in W3C adding work on CSS to the deliverables of the HTML editorial review board (ERB). Lie and Bos were the primary technical staff on this aspect of the project, with additional members, including Thomas Reardon of Microsoft, participating as well. In August 1996, Netscape Communication Corporation presented an alternative style sheet language called JavaScript Style Sheets (JSSS).[24] The spec was never finished, and is deprecated.[33] By the end of 1996, CSS was ready to become official, and the CSS level 1 Recommendation was published in December.
                                
                                Development of HTML, CSS, and the DOM had all been taking place in one group, the HTML Editorial Review Board (ERB). Early in 1997, the ERB was split into three working groups: HTML Working Group, chaired by Dan Connolly of W3C; DOM Working group, chaired by Lauren Wood of SoftQuad; and CSS Working Group, chaired by Chris Lilley of W3C.
                                
                                The CSS Working Group began tackling issues that had not been addressed with CSS level 1, resulting in the creation of CSS level 2 on November 4, 1997. It was published as a W3C Recommendation on May 12, 1998. CSS level 3, which was started in 1998, is still under development as of 2014.
                                
                                In 2005, the CSS Working Groups decided to enforce the requirements for standards more strictly. This meant that already published standards like CSS 2.1, CSS 3 Selectors, and CSS 3 Text were pulled back from Candidate Recommendation to Working Draft level.
                                
                                Difficulty with adoption
                                The CSS 1 specification was completed in 1996. Microsoft's Internet Explorer 3[24] was released that year, featuring some limited support for CSS. IE 4 and Netscape 4.x added more support, but it was typically incomplete and had many bugs that prevented CSS from being usefully adopted. It was more than three years before any web browser achieved near-full implementation of the specification. Internet Explorer 5.0 for the Macintosh, shipped in March 2000, was the first browser to have full (better than 99 percent) CSS 1 support,[34] surpassing Opera, which had been the leader since its introduction of CSS support fifteen months earlier. Other browsers followed soon afterward, and many of them additionally implemented parts of CSS 2.
                                
                                However, even when later "version 5" web browsers began to offer a fairly full implementation of CSS, they were still incorrect in certain areas. They were fraught with inconsistencies, bugs, and other quirks. Microsoft Internet Explorer 5. x for Windows, as opposed to the very different IE for Macintosh, had a flawed implementation of the CSS box model, as compared with the CSS standards. Such inconsistencies and variation in feature support made it difficult for designers to achieve a consistent appearance across browsers and platforms without the use of workarounds termed CSS hacks and filters. The IE Windows box model bugs were so serious that, when Internet Explorer 6 was released, Microsoft introduced a backward-compatible mode of CSS interpretation ("quirks mode") alongside an alternative, corrected "standards mode". Other non-Microsoft browsers also provided mode-switch capabilities. It, therefore, became necessary for authors of HTML files to ensure they contained special distinctive "standards-compliant CSS intended" marker to show that the authors intended CSS to be interpreted correctly, in compliance with standards, as opposed to being intended for the now long-obsolete IE5/Windows browser. Without this marker, web browsers with the "quirks mode"-switching capability will size objects in web pages as IE 5 on Windows would, rather than following CSS standards.
                                
                                Problems with the patchy adoption of CSS and errata in the original specification led the W3C to revise the CSS 2 standards into CSS 2.1, which moved nearer to a working snapshot of current CSS support in HTML browsers. Some CSS 2 properties that no browser successfully implemented were dropped, and in a few cases, defined behaviors were changed to bring the standard into line with the predominant existing implementations. CSS 2.1 became a Candidate Recommendation on February 25, 2004, but CSS 2.1 was pulled back to Working Draft status on June 13, 2005,[35] and only returned to Candidate Recommendation status on July 19, 2007.[36]
                                
                                In addition to these problems, the .css extension was used by a software product used to convert PowerPoint files into Compact Slide Show files,[37] so some web servers served all .css[38] as MIME type application/x-pointplus[39] rather than text/css.
                                
                                Vendor prefixes
                                Individual browser vendors occasionally introduced new parameters ahead of standardization and universalization. To prevent interfering with future implementations, vendors prepended unique names to the parameters, such as -moz- for Mozilla Firefox, -webkit- named after the browsing engine of Apple Safari, -o- for Opera Browser and -ms- for Microsoft Internet Explorer and early versions of Microsoft Edge that use EdgeHTML.
                                
                                Occasionally, the parameters with vendor prefixes such as -moz-radial-gradient and -webkit-linear-gradient have slightly different syntax as compared to their non-vendor-prefix counterparts.[40]
                                
                                Prefixed properties are rendered obsolete by the time of standardization. Programs are available to automatically add prefixes for older browsers and to point out standardized versions of prefixed parameters. Since prefixes are limited to a small subset of browsers, removing the prefix allows other browsers to see the functionality. An exception is certain obsolete -webkit- prefixed properties, which are so common and persistent on the web that other families of browsers have decided to support them for compatibility.[41]
                                
                                
                                CSS Snapshot 2021
                                CSS has various levels and profiles. Each level of CSS builds upon the last, typically adding new features and typically denoted[42] as CSS 1, CSS 2, CSS 3, and CSS 4. Profiles are typically a subset of one or more levels of CSS built for a particular device or user interface. Currently, there are profiles for mobile devices, printers, and television sets. Profiles should not be confused with media types, which were added in CSS 2.
                                
                                CSS 1
                                The first CSS specification to become an official W3C Recommendation is CSS level 1, published on 17 December 1996. Håkon Wium Lie and Bert Bos are credited as the original developers.[43][44] Among its capabilities are support for
                                
                                Font properties such as typeface and emphasis
                                Color of text, backgrounds, and other elements
                                Text attributes such as spacing between words, letters, and lines of text
                                Alignment of text, images, tables and other elements
                                Margin, border, padding, and positioning for most elements
                                Unique identification and generic classification of groups of attributes
                                The W3C no longer maintains the CSS 1 Recommendation.[45]
                                
                                CSS 2
                                CSS level 2 specification was developed by the W3C and published as a recommendation in May 1998. A superset of CSS 1, CSS 2 includes a number of new capabilities like absolute, relative, and fixed positioning of elements and z-index, the concept of media types, support for aural style sheets (which were later replaced by the CSS 3 speech modules)[46] and bidirectional text, and new font properties such as shadows.
                                
                                The W3C no longer maintains the CSS 2 recommendation.[47]
                                
                                CSS 2.1
                                CSS level 2 revision 1, often referred to as "CSS 2.1", fixes errors in CSS 2, removes poorly supported or not fully interoperable features and adds already implemented browser extensions to the specification. To comply with the W3C Process for standardizing technical specifications, CSS 2.1 went back and forth between Working Draft status and Candidate Recommendation status for many years. CSS 2.1 first became a Candidate Recommendation on 25 February 2004, but it was reverted to a Working Draft on 13 June 2005 for further review. It returned to Candidate Recommendation on 19 July 2007 and then updated twice in 2009. However, because changes and clarifications were made, it again went back to Last Call Working Draft on 7 December 2010.
                                
                                CSS 2.1 went to Proposed Recommendation on 12 April 2011.[48] After being reviewed by the W3C Advisory Committee, it was finally published as a W3C Recommendation on 7 June 2011.[49]
                                
                                CSS 2.1 was planned as the first and final revision of level 2—but low-priority work on CSS 2.2 began in 2015.
                                
                                CSS 3
                                "CSS3" redirects here. For other uses, see CSS3 (disambiguation).
                                Unlike CSS 2, which is a large single specification defining various features, CSS 3 is divided into several separate documents called "modules". Each module adds new capabilities or extends features defined in CSS 2, preserving backward compatibility. Work on CSS level 3 started around the time of publication of the original CSS 2 recommendation. The earliest CSS 3 drafts were published in June 1999.[50]
                                
                                Due to the modularization, different modules have different stability and statuses.[51]
                                
                                Some modules have Candidate Recommendation (CR) status and are considered moderately stable. At CR stage, implementations are advised to drop vendor prefixes.[52]

                                "CSS4" redirects here. For other uses, see CSS4 (disambiguation).
                                Jen Simmons discussing the state of CSS in 2019, as several CSS 4 modules were being advanced
                                There is no single, integrated CSS4 specification,[54] because the specification has been split into many separate modules which level independently.
                                
                                Modules that build on things from CSS Level 2 started at Level 3. Some of them have already reached Level 4 or are already approaching Level 5. Other modules that define entirely new functionality, such as Flexbox,[55] have been designated as Level 1 and some of them are approaching Level 2.
                                
                                The CSS Working Group sometimes publishes "Snapshots", a collection of whole modules and parts of other drafts that are considered stable enough to be implemented by browser developers. So far, five such "best current practices" documents have been published as Notes, in 2007,[56] 2010,[57] 2015,[58] 2017,[59] and 2018.[60]
                                
                                Since these specification snapshots are primarily intended for developers, there has been a growing demand for a similar versioned reference document targeted at authors, which would present the state of interoperable implementations as meanwhile documented by sites like Can I Use...[61] and the MDN Web Docs.[62] A W3C Community Group has been established in early 2020 in order to discuss and define such a resource.[63] The actual kind of versioning is also up to debate, which means that the document, once produced, might not be called "CSS4".
                                
                                Browser support
                                Each web browser uses a layout engine to render web pages, and support for CSS functionality is not consistent between them. Because browsers do not parse CSS perfectly, multiple coding techniques have been developed to target specific browsers with workarounds (commonly known as CSS hacks or CSS filters). The adoption of new functionality in CSS can be hindered by a lack of support in major browsers. For example, Internet Explorer was slow to add support for many CSS 3 features, which slowed the adoption of those features and damaged the browser's reputation among developers. Additionally, a proprietary syntax for the non-vendor-prefixed filter property was used in some versions.[64] In order to ensure a consistent experience for their users, web developers often test their sites across multiple operating systems, browsers, and browser versions, increasing development time and complexity. Tools such as BrowserStack have been built to reduce the complexity of maintaining these environments.
                                
                                In addition to these testing tools, many sites maintain lists of browser support for specific CSS properties, including CanIUse and the MDN Web Docs. Additionally, CSS 3 defines feature queries, which provide an @supports directive that will allow developers to target browsers with support for certain functionality directly within their CSS.[65] CSS that is not supported by older browsers can also sometimes be patched in using JavaScript polyfills, which are pieces of JavaScript code designed to make browsers behave consistently. These workarounds—and the need to support fallback functionality—can add complexity to development projects, and consequently, companies frequently define a list of browser versions that they will and will not support.
                                
                                As websites adopt newer code standards that are incompatible with older browsers, these browsers can be cut off from accessing many of the resources on the web (sometimes intentionally).[66] Many of the most popular sites on the internet are not just visually degraded on older browsers due to poor CSS support but do not work at all, in large part due to the evolution of JavaScript and other web technologies.
                                
                                Limitations
                                Some noted limitations of the current capabilities of CSS include:
                                
                                Cannot explicitly declare new scope independently of position
                                Scoping rules for properties such as z-index look for the closest parent element with a position: absolute or position: relative attribute. This odd coupling has undesired effects. For example, it is impossible to avoid declaring a new scope when one is forced to adjust an element's position, preventing one from using the desired scope of a parent element.
                                
                                Pseudo-class dynamic behavior not controllable
                                CSS implements pseudo-classes that allow a degree of user feedback by conditional application of alternate styles. One CSS pseudo-class, ":hover", is dynamic (equivalent of JavaScript "onmouseover") and has potential for misuse (e.g., implementing cursor-proximity popups),[67] but CSS has no ability for a client to disable it (no "disable"-like property) or limit its effects (no "nochange"-like values for each property).
                                
                                Cannot name rules
                                There is no way to name a CSS rule, which would allow (for example) client-side scripts to refer to the rule even if its selector changes.
                                
                                Cannot include styles from a rule into another rule
                                CSS styles often must be duplicated in several rules to achieve the desired effect, causing additional maintenance and requiring more thorough testing. Some new CSS features were proposed to solve this but were abandoned afterward.[68][69] Instead, authors may gain this ability by using more sophisticated stylesheet languages which compile to CSS, such as Sass, Less, or Stylus.
                                
                                Cannot target specific text without altering markup
                                Besides the :first-letter pseudo-element, one cannot target specific ranges of text without needing to utilize placeholder elements.
                                
                                Advantages
                                Separation of content from presentation
                                Main article: Separation of content and presentation
                                CSS facilitates the publication of content in multiple presentation formats by adjusting styles based on various nominal parameters. These parameters include explicit user preferences (such as themes or font size), compatibility with different web browsers, the type of device used to view the content (e.g., desktop, tablet, or mobile device), screen resolutions, the geographic location of the user, and many other variables. CSS also enables responsive design, ensuring that content dynamically adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, enhancing accessibility and user experience across a wide range of environments.
                                
                                Site-wide consistency
                                Main article: Style sheet (web development)
                                When CSS is used effectively, in terms of inheritance and "cascading", a global style sheet can be used to affect and style elements site-wide. If the situation arises that the styling of the elements should be changed or adjusted, these changes can be made by editing rules in the global style sheet. Before CSS, this sort of maintenance was more difficult, expensive, and time-consuming.
                                
                                Bandwidth
                                A stylesheet, internal or external, specifies the style once for a range of HTML elements selected by class, type or relationship to others. This is much more efficient than repeating style information inline for each occurrence of the element. An external stylesheet is usually stored in the browser cache, and can therefore be used on multiple pages without being reloaded, further reducing data transfer over a network.
                                
                                Page reformatting
                                Main article: Progressive enhancement
                                With a simple change of one line, a different style sheet can be used for the same page. This has advantages for accessibility, as well as providing the ability to tailor a page or site to different target devices. Furthermore, devices not able to understand the styling still display the content.
                                
                                Accessibility
                                Main article: Tableless web design § Accessibility
                                Without CSS, web designers must typically lay out their pages with techniques such as HTML tables that hinder accessibility for vision-impaired users (see Tableless web design#Accessibility).
                                
                                Standardization
                                Frameworks
                                Main article: CSS framework
                                CSS frameworks are prepared libraries that are meant to allow for easier, more standards-compliant styling of web pages using the Cascading Style Sheets language. CSS frameworks include Blueprint, Bootstrap, Foundation and Materialize. Like programming and scripting language libraries, CSS frameworks are usually incorporated as external .css sheets referenced in the HTML <head>. They provide a number of ready-made options for designing and laying out the web page. Although many of these frameworks have been published, some authors use them mostly for rapid prototyping, or for learning from, and prefer to 'handcraft' CSS that is appropriate to each published site without the design, maintenance and download overhead of having many unused features in the site's styling.[70]
                                
                                Blueprint
                                This paragraph is an excerpt from Blueprint (CSS framework).[edit]
                                Blueprint is a CSS framework designed to reduce development time and ensure cross-browser compatibility when working with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It also serves as a foundation for many tools designed to make CSS development easier and more accessible to beginners.
                                Bootstrap
                                This paragraph is an excerpt from Bootstrap (front-end framework).[edit]
                                Bootstrap (formerly Twitter Bootstrap) is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains HTML, CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.
                                Foundation
                                This paragraph is an excerpt from Foundation (framework).[edit]
                                Foundation is a free responsive front-end framework, providing a responsive grid and HTML and CSS UI components, templates, and code snippets, including typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface elements, as well as optional functionality provided by JavaScript extensions. Foundation is an open source project, and was formerly maintained by ZURB. Since 2019, Foundation has been maintained by volunteers.[71]
                                Design methodologies
                                As the size of CSS resources used in a project increases, a development team often needs to decide on a common design methodology to keep them organized. The goals are ease of development, ease of collaboration during development, and performance of the deployed stylesheets in the browser. Popular methodologies include OOCSS (object-oriented CSS), ACSS (atomic CSS), CSS (organic Cascade Style Sheet), SMACSS (scalable and modular architecture for CSS), and BEM (block, element, modifier).[72]</p>
